Approach for Lineage Problem Statement.
1. Will take the given query in common table expression.
2. Add pivot function t get the column names in extraction list as a a column value.
3. I will take the column value with I have extracted using Pivot in CTE and join 
   it with all_columns table (table in oracle which contains the column and table details in DB)
   in main query
4. Will take all 4 column names and table associate to it using union all.

5. Output will look like

Column Name     |    Table Name
SWB_CNTRY_ID    |  CNTRY_MULTI_DEF_CD_T
CNTRY_TYPE_CD   |  CNTRY_MULTI_DEF_CD_T
DW_EFF_DT       |  CNTRY_MULTI_DEF_CD_T
DW_AS_OF_DT     |  CNTRY_MULTI_DEF_CD_S
